## Lore

<p>
    In a dystopian civilization dominated by the Solarkis 
	mega-corporation, energy across the solar system is monopolized 
	through their ownership of a Dyson Sphere. With fossil fuels 
	exhausted, Solarkis holds an absolute monopoly over energy. 
	Citizens are granted access to free energy for only a few minutes 
	each day via government-issued solar capture devices, allowing the 
	corporation to control all aspects of production.

<p>
    The colonization of the Moon, which began less than a millennium ago,
	has been compromised by mysterious deaths occurring every 13 lunar 
	months. These inexplicable events led to a complete halt in lunar 
	missions, with landings on the Moon being strictly prohibited. 
	Yet, as a scientist driven by curiosity, you are determined to 
	uncover the truth behind these occurrences.
</p>
<p>
    A brilliant mind working in isolation, you are on a quest to 
	discover a new form of exploitable energy to break free from 
	Solarkis' grip. After years of relentless research, you finalize
	a groundbreaking theory in 3025 about capturing astrological energy 
	involving the Moon. Despite the coherence and logic of your research 
	papers, the only way to validate your theory is to embark on a 
	journey to the Moon yourself.
